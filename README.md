## What Problem does it solve?
Project Lab III groups must use Radio Frequency Communication devices to provide constant location tracking of one teammate acting as a 'Rover.' This 'Rover' must move around campus looking for notebooks containing a 'Codeword'. 
Groups must establish constant radio message communication and find at least 3 of 5 codewords.
## How did you solve it?
